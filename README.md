# VLC_Advanced_Bookmark
An advanced bookmark extension for VLC

+The current version of VLC Media Player has a bookmark function but it has a major drawback making it useless for almost all the users.
+This drawback is that once you close the media file, all your bookmarks are lost :(
+
+This is an extension which saves your bookmarks and the next time you open your media file, you have all your bookmarks right there intact :)
