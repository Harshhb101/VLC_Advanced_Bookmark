# VLC_Advanced_Bookmark
An advanced bookmark extension for VLC

+The current version of VLC Media Player has a bookmark function but it has a major drawback making it useless for almost all the users.
+This drawback is that once you close the media file, all your bookmarks are lost :(
+
+This is an extension which saves your bookmarks and the next time you open your media file, you have all your bookmarks right there intact :)

In order to use the extension all you need to do is to download the "lua file" and put it in the following folder according to your Operating System

In Windows: Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions\
In Mac OS X: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/lua/extensions/
In Linux: /usr/lib/vlc/lua/playlist/ or /usr/share/vlc/lua/extensions/

Now restart the VLC media player and thats it. You are ready to go. :)
